# HiveHub
A Complex management system 

HiveHub is a web-based platform targeted at property management agencies to aid
them in the management of communal housing developments, such as complexes,
apartment blocks, retirement villages or homeowners associations.
HiveHub does not only serve managing agencies but a multitude of other users
within a communal housing development that typically interact with them. 

These users compromise of the following roles;

  ● Managing Agents  
  ● Rental Agents  
  ● Owners  
  ● Occupants
  

HiveHub is beneficial to its users as it is a comprehensive information system with
interactive functionality, that will:

  ● Allow the centralisation of communal housing management services which
    are commonly used by all the parties involved in a communal housing development.    
  ● Allow efficient and effective management of all parties within a communal
    housing development.    
  ● Allow interactions amongst communal housing parties in the form of a chat.  
  ● Allow the centralisation of all necessary managing documents.  
  ● Allow all communal housing parties’ information to be centralised and
    therefore easily accessible.    
  ● Allow an owner to assign a rental agent (as a proxy) to manage one of their
    units on their behalf.    
  ● Minimize the effort required by parties to participate in activities and carry out
    their responsibilities.
